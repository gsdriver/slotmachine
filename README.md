# Slot Machine
Alexa skill that allows you to play a slot machine.

When placing your bet, you can specify an amount `bet 5 coins`. If no amount is specified,
then the last amount bet will be used, otherwise 1 coin will be used for your first bet.

After you've placed your bets, you can say `spin` or `pull` to spin the slots. Three symbols
will appear, and you'll get payout according to the table.

At any time, you can ask for help. You will be told how many units you have left and the
payout table for the game.
